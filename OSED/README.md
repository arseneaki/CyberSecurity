***

Resources under the "recommended" section of each chapter are the ones I would personally recommend to study with - all the other resources are also great but should be seen as either "fundamentals only" or an "addition". 
Meaning, if you got the time, please check them out as well, they will definitely help you understand everything more in-depth and more clearly.

Keep in mind that **this** repository is only for the EXP-301 course / OSED certification provided by Offensive-Security and thus does not cover topics like e.g. x64, Heap, Write What Where, etc. 


You think something is missing in this repo? Feel free to reach out to me either via GitHub pull requests or via the Offensive-Security discord server.



My Exploit Development GitHub repository going beyond and above the EXP-301 topics: _coming soon_.
